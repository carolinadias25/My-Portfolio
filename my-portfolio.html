<h1>My Porfolio</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<div>
<p> My name is Carolina, I'm 24 years old and I'm Portuguese.
    Came to Machester in 2019 and I'm loving it!
    I work as a Sales Coordinator for a health care company called <span><a href="https://www.bupa.co.uk/health/health-insurance-ppc?pdg_channel=ppc&pdg_account=brand_pmi&pdg_network=GOOGLE&pdg_campaign=PMI_Brand_Exact&pdg_adgroup=Core&pdg_keyword=bupa+uk&gclid=CjwKCAiAg8OBBhA8EiwAlKw3kknSxC7cpBmQJNDHzG0M2Ks8XmAHAhAL7QIKyF3e_-gOJRJxwNr92hoC5_gQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">BUPA.</a></span>
    Decided to change my career path, last year in 2020,
    I've enrolled in this cohort three weeks ago and I'm finding it very challenging and fun at the same time.
    My main goal after these 7 months, is to find a full time job in this area and start my career as a Software Developer. 
    I like to live my life at a very fast pace, but always making sure that I appreciate every step of the way.</p>
