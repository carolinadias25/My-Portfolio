    <h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="content">
    <p> My name is Carolina, I'm 24 years old and I'm Portuguese. Lived for 2 years in Australia, Melbourne and decided to go back to Europe, to be closer to my family. Loved the experience and it made me grow, both personally and professionally. 
    Came to Machester in 2019 and I'm loving it! (apart from the weather)
    I work as a Sales Coordinator for a health care company called Bupa since June 2020. Decided to change my career path, last year, as I don't see myself doing that for the rest of my life. 
    I've enrolled in this Manchester Codes cohort, four weeks ago and I'm finding it very challenging and fun at the same time.
    My main goal after these 7 months, is to find a full-time job in this area and start my career as a Software Developer. 
    I like to live my life at a very fast pace, but always making sure that I appreciate every step of the way.</p>
